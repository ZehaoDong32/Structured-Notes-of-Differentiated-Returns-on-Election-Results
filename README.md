# Structured-Notes-of-Differentiated-Returns-on-Election-Results
Solution to the IAQF Student Competition Problem(2020)  
The solution contains three main topics:  
- Determine through quantitative methods whether there are truly differences between the two portfolios given and to highlight those differences  
- Determine, again, using quantitative methods whether these portfolios should be expected to perform differently depending on whether the White House is occupied by a Republican or a Democrat  
- Construct structured notes from the portfolios which have a differentiated payoff depending on the outcome of the election
